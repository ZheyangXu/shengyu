# Getting Started

## Vitepress Init

### Installation

VitePress can be used on its own, or be installed into an existing project. In both cases, you can install it with:

```shell
pnpm add -D vitepress
```

### Setup Wizard

VitePress ships with a command line setup wizard that will help you scaffold a basic project. After installation, start the wizard by running:

```shell
pnpm vitepress init
```

You will be greeted with a few simple questions:

```shell
‚îå  Welcome to VitePress!
‚îÇ
‚óá  Where should VitePress initialize the config?
‚îÇ  ./docs
‚îÇ
‚óá  Site title:
‚îÇ  My Awesome Project
‚îÇ
‚óá  Site description:
‚îÇ  A VitePress Site
‚îÇ
‚óÜ  Theme:
‚îÇ  ‚óè Default Theme (Out of the box, good-looking docs)
‚îÇ  ‚óã Default Theme + Customization
‚îÇ  ‚óã Custom Theme
‚îî
```

### Up and Running

The tool should have also injected the following npm scripts to your package.json if you allowed it to do so during the setup process:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "docs:dev": "vitepress dev docs",
    "docs:build": "vitepress build docs",
    "docs:preview": "vitepress preview docs"
  },
  ...
}
```

The docs:dev script will start a local dev server with instant hot updates. Run it with the following command:

```shell
pnpm run docs:dev
```

or

```shell
pnpm vitepress dev docs
```

## Useful Support

### Markdown Math Support

This is currently opt-in. To enable it, you need to install `markdown-it-mathjax3` and set `markdown.math` to `true` in your config file:

```shell
pnpm add -D markdown-it-mathjax3
```

```ts
// .vitepress/config.ts
export default {
  markdown: {
    math: true
  }
}
```

### Mermaid Support

Install the [vitepress-plugin-mermaid](https://github.com/emersonbottero/vitepress-plugin-mermaid).

```shell
pnpm add -D vitepress-plugin-mermaid mermaid

pnpm install --shamefully-hoist 
```

Add wrapper in `config.mts`:

```ts
// .vitepress/config.js
import { withMermaid } from "vitepress-plugin-mermaid";

export default withMermaid({
  // your existing vitepress config...
  mermaid:{
    //mermaidConfig !theme here works for ligth mode since dark theme is forced in dark mode
  },
  ...
});
```

Use in any Markdown file

```
<!---any-file.md-->

flowchart TD
  Start --> Stop
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Start --> Stop
```

See the [docs üìï](https://emersonbottero.github.io/vitepress-plugin-mermaid/)
and a [complex example üòé](https://emersonbottero.github.io/vitepress-plugin-mermaid/guide/more-examples.html#render)

## Deploy

### Build and Test Locally

1. Run this command to build the docs:

```shell
pnpm run docs:build
```

2. Once built, preview it locally by running:

```shell
pnpm run docs:preview
```

The preview command will boot up a local static web server that will serve the output directory .vitepress/dist at http://localhost:4173. You can use this to make sure everything looks good before pushing to production.

3. You can configure the port of the server by passing `--port` as an argument.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "docs:preview": "vitepress preview docs --port 8080"
  }
}
```

### Setting a Public Base Path

By default, we assume the site is going to be deployed at the root path of a domain (/). If your site is going to be served at a sub-path, e.g. https://mywebsite.com/blog/, then you need to set the base option to '/blog/' in the VitePress config.

Example: If you're using Github (or GitLab) Pages and deploying to user.github.io/repo/, then set your base to /repo/.

### Github Pages

1. Create a file named `deploy.yml` inside `.github/workflows` directory of your project with some content like this:

```yaml
# ÊûÑÂª∫ VitePress Á´ôÁÇπÂπ∂Â∞ÜÂÖ∂ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤Âà∞ GitHub Pages ÁöÑÁ§∫‰æãÂ∑•‰ΩúÊµÅÁ®ã

::: warning
Make sure the `base` option in your VitePress is properly configured. See Setting a Public Base Path for more details.
:::

2. In your repository's settings under "Pages" menu item, select "GitHub Actions" in "Build and deployment > Source".

3. Push your changes to the `main` branch and wait for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete. You should see your site deployed to `https://<username>.github.io/[repository]/` or `https://<custom-domain>/` depending on your settings. Your site will automatically be deployed on every push to the main branch.

### Nginx

Here is a example of an Nginx server block configuration. This setup includes gzip compression for common text-based assets, rules for serving your VitePress site's static files with proper caching headers as well as handling `cleanUrls: true`.

```nginx
server {
    gzip on;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;

    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        # content location
        root /app;

        # exact matches -> reverse clean urls -> folders -> not found
        try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;

        # non existent pages
        error_page 404 /404.html;

        # a folder without index.html raises 403 in this setup
        error_page 403 /404.html;

        # adjust caching headers
        # files in the assets folder have hashes filenames
        location ~* ^/assets/ {
            expires 1y;
            add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
        }
    }
}
```

This configuration assumes that your built VitePress site is located in the `/app` directory on your server. Adjust the `root` directive accordingly if your site's files are located elsewhere.

::: warning
Do not default to index.html

The try_files resolution must not default to index.html like in other Vue applications. This would result in an invalid page state.
